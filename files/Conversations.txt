# This file contains all conversations
# All lines that begin with a "#" character are considered comments
# The format for the conversation is the following:
# 
# Number of normal characters
# Codes of the normal characters (one in each line)
# Number of glitch characters
# Codes of the glitch characters (one in each line)
# Code of the speaker
# Code of the listener
# String that represents the text that is spoken
# Blank line
# ... (the four last lines repeat until the blank line is a dollar symbol)
# Dollar symbol
# 
# A blank line means "this is the end of an Interaction"
# and a dollar symbol means "this is the end of a Conversation"
# Finally, a @ symbol means "end of the file"
# Every conversation has a code, which appears in the comment that comes before it
